# HySync
HySync started out as an idea by Aerh ([@easter](https://github.com/easter)), by having the ability to have your ranks show on your server - especially useful for guild-based servers. The idea became a reality when he teamed up with Charlie ([@charliejoseph](https://github.com/charliejoseph)). We hope by being open sourced, others can help contribute to the project and help form this into something spectacular.

## Installation
1. **Download** the latest version by clicking [here](https://hysync.org/download).
2. Move HySync.jar into your `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Once it has rebooted, execute `/hysync` via the console.
